1. Request -> Any sort of data/command/process coming into the application
2. Response -> Any sort of Data/JSON/Result shared by the application on receiving some request
3. Filter Chain -> It comes between response and the application
                -> Consists of series of filters
                -> Once the request goes through all the filters, it reaches the controllers
                -> Each filter has a series of jobs based on their configuration
                -> Without spring security we have filters but with spring security we have a special filter called Authentication Filter
4. Authentication filter -> Intercepts the authentication requests and fetches username and passowrd (or any other field) to create an authentication object
5. Authentication Manager -> Authentication object is passed on the authentication manager and this manager decides what to do with these objects
6. Authentication Provider (DaoAuthentication Provider) -> It is used by authentication manager to validate the credentials
7. Password Encoder -> Used by authen. provider to validate
                    -> Helps to encode and decode the password while saving and fetching
8. UserDetailsService -> It is called by AP to load the user details.
                      -> It uses methods like loadByUsername() to load the data and findByUsername() to find the user from db
The userdetaislservice returns the UserDetails object which consists of all the data about user (roles, number etc)
This data is then added to the authentication object which was first created by the authentication filer
9. Security Context -> It stores the context of complete authentication and all the info about authentication object is stored in security context
                    -> This tells about the object ex : telling what the user is allowed to do or not
